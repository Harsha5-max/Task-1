# Task-1: Stock Prediction Using LSTM

Introduction:

This project is dedicated to the application of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks in predicting stock prices and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). Leveraging the YAHOO Finance API through the yfinance library, we obtain the necessary data for analysis. By employing the powerful data manipulation tools provided by Pandas, and the visualization capabilities of Matplotlib and Seaborn, we conduct a thorough exploration and analysis of the obtained time-series data. Moreover, we focus on evaluating the correlation between various stocks and measuring the associated investment risks, thereby enabling users to make more informed decisions.

Project Goals:

Load and preprocess stock market data from the YAHOO Finance website using the yfinance library.
Explore and visualize time-series data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, providing comprehensive insights into the market trends and fluctuations.
Assess the correlation between different stocks to identify potential interdependencies and market dynamics.
Implement effective risk measurement strategies for evaluating the investment potential of specific stocks, aiding users in making informed investment decisions.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

Conclusion:

By combining LSTM networks with comprehensive data analysis and visualization techniques, this project provides an effective framework for predicting stock prices and evaluating investment risks. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for both individual investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions in the dynamic stock market landscape.
